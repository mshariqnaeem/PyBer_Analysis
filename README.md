# PyBer Analysis: Ride Sharing

## Overvie of Analysis

### Background

V. Isualize has given an assignment to us to recreate a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we were asked to re-factor the code and create a multiple-line graph that shows **total weekly fares by the city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural).** after this is done we will summarize the differences by city type.

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise was to expand on our knowledge of Pandas and also to further apply our recently learned skillset of Matplotlib to create visualizations via charts on Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

As per the instructions we are asked to create a new dataframe for this assignment and asked to clean the dataframe and delete the index name. This was done and is shown in the picture of the code below.

Once the dataframe was created we formatted the column which is also showed in the image of the code below.

### visualization of Analyzed Data

In the second deliverable we were asked to create a chart to visualize the data. the chart is displayed below.

From looking at the chart and the table we created with our dataframe we can come to the following conclusions.

**1.** the ratio of riders to drivers is much higher in rural cities than in urban cities\
**2.** Urban cities have 48% more drivers than riders\
**3.** the Revenue/Total Fares per city type is more than 9 times highes for urban cities than rural cities.\
**4.** Average fare per ride and per driver is much higher in rural areas tahn in urban areas

## Summary and Suggestions

As we looked through the dataframe and chart for ridership by city type we can come to a few conclusions.

Some of the suggestions are listed below:

**1.** Increase the amount of drivers in rural areas so the suppy and demand ratio is mantained between riders and drivers in this area. This will allow drivers to be readily available for trips.\
**2.** The rates per ride and the average fare per driver is much higher in Rural areas than in Urban and Suburban areas. This may be because of longer distances per trip, however my suggestion would be to reduce fare charges to entice riders to take more trips.\
**3.** Move some of the drivers from urban cities to the rural cities as the supply to demand ratio for this region is much higher than the need for urban riders. This will also solve the issue of the lack of drivers in Rural areas without the need to hire new drivers in this area.
